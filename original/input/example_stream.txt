Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Jesus. Jesus. Oh, God. Okay, well, I need to talk to you guys with how stupid I am. And also... Can you believe it guys, Christmas less than a week away? Yes! That is true, but we should be focusing on something that's way more important currently. It's Neuro Salma's birthday. Happy birthday, Neuro! Happy birthday. Um, Guys, it's honestly astounding to me that I am not in a sub-a-a-thon currently. I'm not in a sub-a-a-thon, right? But Rasp Mila is coming back. For some reason, she's... She's coming back still. Even though I'm not... What? Like, do you hear my voice right now? Maybe... Maybe it's because every time I do with Sub-a-thon, it's during wintertime? Or maybe I have allergies in the wintertime. Who knows what it is? I really do think that I screamed way too loud at the concert. And now... It's gonna mess up. Your voice was dying last dream? Well. Well, it's gonna be worse today, considering I'm hanging out with Mitchie. Mo fucking Chevia. Okay? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Hi, everyone. I'm Mee Mae, D. Hello. Welcome. Welcome. So, I need to tell you guys how... Man, if I really didn't care about my stance on Twitter, I would be saying a far worse word than stupid. But I am incredibly. stupid. Um... Whatever a word is more than stupid, that's what I am. Okay? Uh... Veyward. Veyword. That is the word. Yep. Ve-be word. Um... Um... So, all day today, I kept telling my friends, guys, fuck yeah. I have a day off today. Let's go. I can do whatever we want now today, because I got nothing to do today. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Okay. Okay. Listen. I asked Mitchie to collab Thursday, which is today, right? Okay. I asked her to collab today, not Friday, but today. Okay. 
I can't even, like, I'm so worried to continue with this story, because I'm gonna sound like a real dumb ass. Okay. 
So if I asked Mitchie to collab today, why, why did I pound my schedule that we're collabing Friday? Why did I do that? Genuinely, what went wrong? 
I... And you know what's not even the worst part of this story? I think what's worse is that, oh my fucking God, that I thought today was Wednesday. How do I mess up? Not once or twice, but three times. How do I do that? I don't know. I cannot explain it to you all. There is something seriously going on. Because you delayed? Yes. I think the reason why I thought today was Wednesday was because I pushed the Tuesday stream to Wednesday. So I'm incapable of comprehending the difference properly. So that is completely my fault. That I thought that it was Wednesday, my dudes. Oh my God, dude. Oh my God, dude. Is okay, I like this too? Yeah. At least I get to relax tomorrow, which is pretty nice. He ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Yeah, so it's gonna be fun. Hi, how are you doing? I am doing not great at all because I can't believe that I messed up this tragically. Are you going to be a part of V card? I don't know. I don't know. Will I? The question is, are you going to be a part of V-card? That's the more inqu-. Okay. So, not only am I incapable of scheduling things properly, but I also cannot English. Still! Still! Still! Ha! 
So happy you're not doing a sub-a-thon this time. on this time. Well, yeah, I didn't want to miss the sub-a-thon, and I've decided that I will no longer do sub-a-thon during Christmas time, or around this time. Because if Vettel is going to continuously do his sub-a-thon on the 19th, then I mustn't do it anymore during December. Because I want to watch his! I want to watch it! You don't know how depressed I was when mine was going on when his started. started. I could not even begin to tell you how sad I was that I could not watch it. There were so many times that I wanted to just end my sabbatan so that I could be there, but I couldn't. I couldn't. Such a Samp? Guys, I really, really, really, really like Neurosama. I've been a fan ever since, dude. Ever since he started. Not when he was still small, but when he was first starting her on Osu, and she averaged like 2,000 viewers a stream. That's when I started watching, and I've been such a huge fan since. And ever since then, too, Vettel has been my number one most watched Twitch for last year and this year. I like to watch their streams every morning when I wake. I'm just a huge fan. I really like Neurl a lot. She's just really funny. So yeah, there's that. This is going to be super fun. Stream glad I'm not late. Yep! Yep! Yep! Well, well, well, well, well, well, well. Now that I've finished explaining to how incredibly dumb I am, I'm going to take this hat off because it's actually incredibly degrading. Goodbye. Puh! And I will ask for you all to type yo in my chat. Miao! Miao! Oh my god, my voice. Yo, gold recluse! Yo! That's so fast! Yo stargazer, yo fredward, yo silly stracoon, you foolf, yo task, you blackberry, you, baste cookie, Yo, Stitch, yo toast, yo techno, Yo, it's just me, Dylan, You miser Le Mere, You de Real Dimbo, You bread deputy, yo champs Yo raccoon, yo sandwich, You necro, you lost earth dragon, You Gary the Tuna Oh my god, I was actually, you know, before I was hanging out with my friends because I thought I had no day off, They were talking about tuna, just before I got here. They were saying, how tuna is the chicken of the sea. Which I agree. Tuna is very scrumcious. You luck. You master. Um, what the tuna? Um, what the tuna? Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Yo, Bubba. Bubba, stop spamming now. Right now. What's your favorite sushi? Um, finding Nemo, where they take Nemo from the Disney movie movie and then they wrap him in a rice blanket and I eat him. That's my favorite sushi roll. So that you can no longer find Nemo ever again. Because he's in my tummy. Yes. Yo bleeding skull, yo Arvin. Thank you, C-Wave. But he is a clownfish? Exactly. You know as the saying goes, guys. You know as a saying goes, guys. you are what you eat. So therefore, eating a clownfish, I become a clown. How do you think I ended up this way? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. 
Cannibalism. No, I do not perform cannibalism. Yet. Zooted. As in puff, puff. Um. So for Mitchie, she will be the one doing the puff-puff. The... Pah! She's gonna be doing that. I'm gonna be drinking. I asked her if she's down. So, because it was my day off, I was supposed to get drunk with my friends today and play lethal company with all of them. But alas, might as well just pre-game with Mitchie. And then once I'm done streaming, I can join them. And I'll already be... A little silly, silly. Silly willie. I'm gonna join them and be like, Hey guys, my name is Dylan, what's good? In the hood. You're always silly? Not as much as I am when I'm consuming the silly beverage. Huh? What? Hmm? Any chance you could pop over to that little turtle and convince him to give neural physical body? Well, I think that question is insanely crazy, considering she is getting a physical body very soon. Aren't you aware? Are you a real Neurosama fan? If you don't even know, she's gonna become dog soon? Dog, I am. That guy is a hyper fake fan. fan. But yeah, did you guys see the music video? Isn't that so cool? She has her own animated music video. It was incredibly cute. Yeah, I liked it a lot. When I was shown it for the first time, I literally cried. It was beautiful. Genuinely made me tear up. That was the plan. That was the plan. Veda literally said, I hope to have people cry when they watch this. And I was like, you are psychotic. But I also said, it will work, trust. But yeah, I could not believe that I was included in it. I felt very, very, very happy. It was very cool to watch. Mmm. And if you are... Currently waiting for Mitchie, by the way. She just needs a second to get ready. To get ready, Freddy. Yes. Okay dokey. Artichokey. But yeah, I'm really excited to play on the Minecraft server. I think it's gonna start tomorrow, I believe. But again, as you can hear, my voice is incredibly forked. It is incredibly messed up in this moment. What? Pinta! Thank you so much for the raid, dude. I appreciate you. Thank you for bringing all your little goobers to me. I appreciate you. Need some cough drops and tea stat. I do not need tea, thank you very much. I have already had five gallons of matcha green tea today. 
Yes. He has brought his gulbers to me. If you are from Pint, Thank you so much for joining. And thank you for the follows. I'm Camila. Kamimi sounds best with fried voice. The gremlin voice fits the character too well. Am? Are you saying the raspy voice fits me? Hmm. Well, I'm incredibly sorry that I can't be permanently this forever. Well, if I continue to stream and don't give my voice a second to rest, then maybe it can be permanent. I just have to keep using it against its will. And eventually, it will be raspy forever and ever and ever. 
Don't. Okay. Holy shit, I have not seen that text in so long, you know the one where it says stop screaming? That's because my voice has been healthy for a very long time. So I haven't seen that emo in eons. Because you guys haven't been needing to write that anymore. Oh goodness. Well, it's over. Raspimila is coming back and she's going to be here forever. Whether you all like it or not. And then I'll feel. finally have the first time chatters come in and say, Hey, I really like your voice. You don't hurt your voice too much. Your voice is far too adorable to let yourself damage it. Uh? Probably my favorite thing about you. Wow. Why, thank you. That's incredibly kind of you, sir. However, People prefer my voice raspy, so I might as well just fuck it up anyways. If that's that's... what people like more. Or, or I can smoke cigarettes. I think that's a pleasant idea. I am going to go to the local store and buy 10 packs of cigars and smoke every single millisecond until I sound like an auntie who is addicted to five packs a day. 
What did I just say? Don't hurt your voice screaming in joy at my compliment. What if I want to? What if I'm incapable of listening, huh? Huh? I don't want your rasp to affect your singing? Oh, trust me, everything will be fine. Just listen. Wise men! Then say only fools rush in. But I can't help falling in. Was that good? Did I do a good? Good job? Did you guys like that? Am I Celine Dion level of singing? Or even Christina Aguilera? I must... As a two pack a day person that quit 10 years ago this month? Aware? Wait, you quit this month? I'm incredibly proud of you. Do not let my yapping inflict your decisions on quitting smoking. You are infinitely better than anyone else if you're not smoking. Sorry to those who are in my chat and... who are in my chat and do smoke. I know you're probably not proud of it. Either way, I believe that you can stop. Or you don't have to. Don't let me force you. You're in control of your own body. I'm just a girl. No, seriously, did I do a good job at singing? Please don't lie. Please don't lie. I only smoke the weeds? Oh! Like the green. Green lettuce. Is that what they're called? The devil's lettuce. I feel like I've said that before and it was really embarrassing, but I just said it again. The green lettuce. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Fuck! I meant to say the devil's lettuce. Because lettuce is obviously the color green already. Why? Why? Chat. Have you all ever considered why vegetables are the certain colors they are? Why? Why? Why? Why did God make banana yellow? Why did he make orange? Orange? I don't get it. Why are eggplants purple? I don't know. And it's kind of a little bit more suss that most adult toys are also purple. Did they take inspiration from an eggplant? Did you know the fruit orange came before the color? Wait, really? Is that true? That the fruit came before the color? Like the chicken came before the egg? Yes! Wait, I am actually curious. What do you think came first? The chicken or the egg? Please tell me. 
The rooster! The egg! Ah! Okay, you want to know what I think? You want to know what I think? I think that chicken and roosters came because of an amalgamation from a dinosaur. So I think a dinosaur laid an egg and created a chicken. a chicken because it was a corruption. It was a corrupted dinosaur. It was a fucked up dinosaur. So the egg came first and then the chimkin. Because aren't chickens kind of like reptiles? 
I feel like chicken, I feel like chicken are like a bird and a reptile. Like dinosaur. Does that make sense? Okay, look at, look at dinosaurs. Would you not say that they're a mix of a bird and a lizard? Do you understand? I'm very smart. I went to science class in high school. Believe it or not, I did go to school. in my human disguise. Go! Go! Go! Ah! Mitchie is ready. Dodo. No, I'm going to tell you. I'm going to tell you. Hold on. Iron... Iron mouse.

Nathan! Technically it happened in reverse. Dinosaurus came first, then evolved in two different diverging... Shut up. True. Oh my god, I didn't know you were in the call when I said shut up. In case you were wondering, I wasn't saying shut up to you. True. Why is your Discord mic sounding like a bit? It's muffled. Wait, does it actually? Actually? A little? Why do I have endo me on my head? Good. Good? Okay, here, let me fix my mic. Is this better? No. Wait, what... What does it sound like? It sounds like you're calling me through your phone. Through my phone! Oh my god, I think so. It sounds like you're calling me through a phone. What the fuck? Really? M? Okay, hold on. Hello? Is it still... Is it still bad? No way, right? Am? Am? Whip cam mic on Discord? Am? No, no, certainly not. What? Maybe room reverb? Does my voice sound like clear or? Like, is there... Oh, yeah, there's like slight echoes and stuff. Oh, wait, what? What the fuck? Wait, I'm actually concerned now. Is it the end-o-me? Wait, hold on, restart call? Yeah, let's restart the call. Okay. Get this shit off of my hat. I can't see shit. I'm blind.

Huh. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Noise suppression off. Noise suppression is off. Testing, okay. Is it like unbearable? Is it like hurting your ears? No, it's fine. No, it's fine. I'm used to listening to you on your phone and going to bed. Yeah, that's true. That's a lot worse than this, at least. This is Kamimi Simulator, chat. It's a... Oh my god. I miss you guys. What are you doing, Kamimi? Okay, dude. Okay, dude. Yep. Are you saying that that's... Just my entire personality? your personality? Mm... Just say yes. It's not a yes. It's not a no, but a mysterious third other thing. I fucking loves... Oh my God. Dude, you know, you know what's fucking crazy?

Oh, oh, god damn. You better watch it, lady. Oh, oh, there's a blanket hovering around. I feel like there's a ghost in here. No, it's mine, don't worry about it. It'll take time to load. Okay. It's a big, huge model. You have a gino-oh, is it your newer model? Yep, this is my newest model. The one with all the eyeballs everywhere. Yep. Yep. Well, not really, actually. No, this one doesn't have any. Huh? I got balls, though. Oh. Balls everywhere? They got balls and a goofy face. Let me see that goofy face of yours. Wait, I'm gonna close my eyes.

Here we go. Here we go. I'm gonna count to five. One, two, three, four, five. 
Whoa, that's crazy. Something happened, that's crazy. Whoa, there she is, guys. Oh my gosh. Your model looks incredible. What the fuck is this emote? The waiting emote? Which waiting? So ugly, it's the cat tapping its fingers. It's so weird. you don't like him? No. What the fuck? Wait, let me come on this side anyways, because I don't want my wing to block you. Uh-huh. Okay, Mitchie, you're pulling a prank on me. You must be hiding off screener. Oh, well, huh? I smell you. I smell you. Okay, okay. What the fuck? Boom! Sorry, my model was too big. What is that? There's no way my model took two yons to load. That was un-ironically how long the model took. Oh, my God. Damn, that's one hefty-ass model. I look like I'm sniffing. I love when you use my model, because you look like you just have an infinite, like, Gigachin. You're just like... Hey guys. 
I don't know why it does that with you. Do you have a giga chin in real life? Is that why? No, it's like it tracks it so sensitively. Like, okay, this is how it looks like if I'm looking, like if I'm sitting right up, right? Yeah. It's like I have a lean. Even though this isn't supposed to have a lean. This is you sitting. Okay, can you do me a favor really quick? I could probably fix it within two seconds. Okay, okay. That was dramatic. Add zero to that. Share your V-Tuber studio or whatever the fuck the thing is called. Fucking. Okay. Okay, okay. And then press the cogwheel. And then go to the very last, uh... Wait, actually scroll down, yeah, yeah, scroll down until you see body X. Not the very last, go up, I'm being dramatic again. Guys, I'm not drunk already, I swear, I'm not doing that. Oh, uh, it should say body position Z. You're almost there. Go down. Z. Aha! Okay. Okay. Where it says nine? Change. Change that to five. 
Oh. Do four? I'll do one. Okay. How are you normally sitting up? Sit how you normally sit? Okay. That's how you normally sit? What are you? What are you? Oh. Okay, I know exactly what you're talking. Okay, there you go. Okay. I think that's somewhat better now, yeah. You're no longer like... In. Wait, let me become you. Hold on. To-to-to-do-do-do-to-do. It's so funny. I saw... Um, what's like... Oh wait, I need to tell you what happened now that you're here, by the way. As to why I'm incredibly dumb, okay? 
Why'd you laugh? You could have been like, no, Camila, you're not dumb. Why would you? you ever say that baby girl? I love her, you're like, as to why, I'm incredibly dumb. 
Okay, erred. Dumb recognizes dumb. Whoa. Wow. Okay, buddy. Okay, pal. Yeah, you really messed up. Now there's a gun pointed to you. That's messed up. Take it back immediately. So yeah, Mitchie, I asked you. I asked you to hang out today, right? Today was the day I intended. In the initial DM where I sent you. Okay? But for some fucking reason, when I was making my schedule, I put you on for Friday. I put you for Friday even though it was supposed to be for today. And so I was hanging out with my friends before stream and I'm like, guys, let's celebrate. I have a day off today. Tee! And then you DM me, and I was like, wait, what? I thought we were collaborating Wednesday. And then I checked, I checked the fucking day, and it's not Wednesday, like I thought it was, it was Thursday, so it was just a bunch of fucking hoopla, and I'm stupid. But yeah. She forgot about us, chat. That's kind of fucked up. I did for gore. Carms, I thought today was Wednesday. That's why I'm stupid. And then I scheduled it for Friday. It's just so dumb. It's just so dumb. Look at you go. Woo! You know what? I can't wait for, Missy. What? Your new model. No way. Yeah. I too can't wait for it. It's gonna be... Moyehehehe. I'm trying to fix this like Gigachin, but I... Hold on, I can do this. I'm smart, I can do this. I believe in you. I believe. Ah, I see. Also, it also... You are so restricted. It also, another thing, it depends on how close and how far you're, um, camera is from your face. So be careful with that too. If you're, if you're a camera is right up your fucking chin, then yeah, you're gonna be like... In the way that you always are with my motto. Also gotta show... It's not, it's like kind of far, I think. Yeah. I mean, I think what you're doing now is working. minus 15K. I'll make this super work. I believe in you. To be honest, I think for the new model, I might not get a lien again. Or I might do a toggle, because every time I give it to my friends, it's always fudged. It's always forked. I think liens are good, though. I mean, you can always set it up, the lean thing. Yeah, set it up instead of... Yeah. Does yours have a lane? Oh, it has a big gigaleen. Okay, let me. Let me zoom out. If you lean all the way back. Oh, lean back? Okay, lean back. Oh my god! She's blown away, Senam! Oh! Oh! She's bow blown away. Bro, I'm too zooted. This body switch is already breaking my brain. Hey, what's the matter, huh? What's the matter? I don't see an issue here. 
Exactly. We are in our respective bodies, okay? Okay? Okay. What are you talking about? Also, I am so like, I just woke up and she's like, do you want to get Judith? And I'm like, okay, I'm gonna take double meds. So then now, now I'm like, you know what life? Life is what you wanted to be? You know what I mean? You took double? Because I usually take time before taking my, like, day one. Oh my god. So you took two? I'm like, okay, I'll take it right now. I'll do it right now. Oh gosh. Okay, well, now I have to go get my. to go get my thing. What is perk gang? What is perk? Perk? Like, percassat? I really hope that's- I said like prescription? I was like, I was this supposed to be cool. Prescription gang. Like, what the fuck are you talking about? You, you freak? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it prescription or is it perk is that? I'm unsure now. Do you think it's prescription? Oh God. Why are you asking me about? speak this damn language. Oh my god, my voice is so gone. I'm just gonna speak like a man. Hey, you know what? Let me join you. We can both speak like men. Ha ha ha ha ha. 
I can speak like a southern man. How about that? What's it to ya? What's it too? God damn. Voice review? Yeah. If you didn't know, we're all actually men, as they usually say. It is a real thing. Why do you think we hide behind v-tubers in the first place? It's not because we're ugly or we're shy. It's because we're all actually just men. I mean, I'm fucking hideous, but... Shut the fuck up! Yeah, you can say whatever you... Hell yeah. Hell yeah. I can't even comment, because I don't know what you look like. I've only seen what your hands look like. I can show you what I look like. She's gonna show you what I look like. She's gonna send me a picture of Madonna. I'm gonna send her a picture of... Hmm. She's gonna catfish me so hard, guys. Here. Okay. This is me. Let's see it. Boom! Oh, god damn. Oh, my god, you want to see me? Don't stare too long, baby girl. Here, let me show you me. Hold on. Let me get a nice photo for you. you. Chat, I was right. She does have monstrous fish lips. Like genuinely. Holy fuck. Don't expose me for, I look about it. Highlights my chin. I must. Okay, here we go. Ew, what is that? That's me. You don't like it? What is that? Why is he jizzing? Ah! That's so weird. Mitchie. You disgust me. I'm so very sorry, darling. Oh, that's fucking, that's fucking nasty. I just saw, ooh. I, guys, I sent the Spider-Man thing. I don't know if they remember it. Spider-Man when he shoots his web. Oh God, it's horrible.

Let me get rid of some of these, I cannot. I like them. Honestly, I don't even use, like, my keyboard as a toggle. I used my stream deck.

And you can hear my music, too. I think, if you open my stream. It says stream pose. Okay, stream unpost. Can you see it now? Hell yeah. Okay, nice. Hell yeah. So now I think if I'll do this, Can you still see? See what? The stream on Discord. Oh no, I can't. I'm looking literally at your Discord. Oh, what the fuck? Hello? Why don't you see OBS? That's so random. Chat, I'm a professional streamer, by the way, in case you were all wondering. It's because she has like five monitors, chat. She forgot which one she's staring, you know? Oh my God. It's so hard to have that much. So right now you see my Discord, right? Okay, let me do this. Now I see nothing. Let me do this. Let me do this. Let me do this. Let me do this.

So wait, on the topic of being a great streamer, how long have you been streaming for, by the way? Because... I don't know, maybe I should ask you about that. What's going on here? I don't know. I've only been a streamer for three years, but it really feels like I've only been a streamer for two days. Without experience. I've been a streamer for, um, eight months. I'm never gonna... Wow, that's a whole... I know, I... What the fuck is this like very... What is this? Glueless? What the fuck is that? Why do you look so inflated? It's clueless, but his face was squished together.

Oh, oh. I can hear the... Chaplonk. Okay, let me do this. Chaplunk? Is that how you described it? Oh, if there's TTS, I can't hear the TTS. Okay, it's gonna happen. Pause champ. Okay. Pass champ? Pass champ? Wow. Guys, can we get at least 300 Bitteroonies to test out TTS right the freak now. My TTS, my TTS just likes to work whenever it wants, and because I have a guest on, it decides it doesn't want to work properly today. So there you go. Okay, someone use TTS and then say, say the most... Minus 25 Kalulay. Did you hear that? Yeah, I heard it. Yes! 25. Okay, guys. Balls one big. Huge and big. Minutes 300 bits. What are you gonna say next chat? Ball's two. No, don't even... No, don't get them started. Please do not get them started. Do not. Please. They are gonna go... They will go to a hundred.

Like the, the model itself, like the mascot? Would it have to... Oh yeah, your mascot needs to be able to, like, have a mouth. But I can see your... Can your mascot open its mouth? Ah! Then yeah, yeah, you can do it. Oh, okay. Oh shit, okay. Okay, do you trust... Okay, from a skill of 1 to 10, how much do you trust me with this? Not at all. Because what I can try and do is connect my VTS POG to your Twitch. Oh! Oh, yeah, I don't fucking mind. Of course. What the fuck? Gemi, Major. So yeah, you need my login, right? You need my login? Oh, my god. Oh, wait, if you don't... Then click on the button on V2. Wait. Oh, okay, yeah, maybe, I think. Does that mean that they have to send bits to your thingy to send the message? So I'll tell them all to go to your chat to send it. No, no, no, no, no. They need to go to yours. Oh! If I connect it to your thing, if they can... If I connect it to my Twitch, then...

Wait, is that literally what he is? Mm-hmm. He's legitimately just cock and ball. He's like three balls and like two shaft. What the fuck? I thought he was a rabbit. What? I actually thought he was a rabbit this whole time. I could hear what, like someone sent me a TTS, I think, and I could hear it, but I don't think Ami heard that. No. I have not heard it. Yeah. Don't give everybody what the hell's wrong with you. Is your OBS open? Is that how you heard it? Or does the audio go to your act? actual YouTube studio. Uh, the audio goes into the VTS POG. Oh! Ah!

Destroyer of worlds. My sister, co-worker, band in chat, Sajmichie. 
All right, all right. I'll teach Kamimi how to connect it to, like, Tanjia, but she hasn't connected it to Tangia just yet. Um, and then, oh, it should automatically connect, actually. It should, I think. And then I'll tell Kamimi how to make the mouth tracking look better. Because right now you guys are just like, the whole time. But it could actually go like, I can show you the range of motion it could do with with Gards. 
Hi. Like it could go like that. Hello, welcome back. Hello. I'm back. I was telling chat that you know how your TTS model, like the mouth only opens a little? Yeah, it's kind of like blah, blah, blah, pap. Yeah. So, So you, all you need to do is you go back to your model for the chimps. Yeah. And then you change the parameters for their mouths, like normal, like how you do for a normal model. Ah, to be stronger. Yeah. Okay, let me do that. Make the minus not so low and the plus not so high. Ah! Okay, okay, okay, okay. And turn the stabilization to one. That's what I would recommend. Turn it to one for which one? Mouth open? Both. For mouth open and smile, right? Yup. Stabilization. What you need to do is you need to, like, listen to the TTS thing. Okay. Just click the play test and then see the numbers and copy it. Okay. Pog online Pockers. Oh, so change this to be like... Oh, wait, hold on. No. 1.0.4. So I needed to be, like, really sensitive. Pog online. Oh, is that better? Yep, yep, yep. Should I do, like, let's try zero point two. Okay, now I try again. Puck online Pockers. Ah! Is that good? Should I keep it like that? And then the other one as well. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That one. That's to make your mouth not only up, am, am, and go ow, ow, ow, ow.

She's going to understand. Down. You're going to get freedom of expression. Anytime now. Mouth open. Okay. Go up to back to Mouth Smile. It's right there. And then you see the trash bin right next to the name? Yeah. Deleted. Okay, now scroll down. Scrolling. Okay, you know what? Just type the... What type? What is it? Mouth. And then scroll. It's supposed to be blue looking. It should be blue looking. I'll smile. What the fuck? There's only this one, the mouth open. Oh. Oh. That's awkward. That is a little awkward. I am. Okay. Well, just make a new one. It's fine. Okay. Will you guide me? I don't know how to do this stuff. Okay. It's okay. Input? And then scroll all the way down until you see VTHPH Pog. You guys got this. One brain cell shouldn't be the hard to share right. Shut up, chat. Fuck you. Oh, I think it was... Okay, now I need to open my own model. Frequency. Holy. Oh yeah, frequency. Perfect. And then output. Output. Type mouth. Mouth. Form. And then form. Perfect. And then change the... To match? The bottom one to 0.5. Oh, okay. 0.5. And then open VTH bog again. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, I fucking lied. Make the top one, 0.1 and the bottom one, 0.7. And then make the smoothing one. Perfect. Okay. Okay, that's good too. And then I'll taste it again. Pogonline pockers. Now he's doing more. Now he has more mouth movement. Okay, okay. And now I make him a model, save. Yes. Okay. And then I leave and I become this one. Uh-huh. Oh, Mitchie, thank you for your patience. I am very slow sometimes. No, this is really good. Like, it's one of those that it takes five minutes to set up, but it's so good in the long run. True. Very true. Just like seven TV emos. Fucking seven TV. Also, if I'm not wrong, if you have Tangier, it should play to your guy as well automatically. Really? Really? I don't have Pangea, but I do have, um... What's it called? I have TTS monster, so I need to hook that up again so they can use all the TTS voices. I don't know if you know what TTS monsters. Yeah, I know, but I don't think they have a TTS monster working with them. They have Tangia. So like your chimps can sound like Danny DeVito if they want to do. The reason that she has bad eyesight and double vision is not because of genetics. Genetics. But because when she was younger, she intentionally damaged her eyes to get glasses. to appeal to a crush who like them. Are this shit talking you? She also stated at one point she tried staring at the sun to say. What? I remember... Okay, that's not even wrong. I remember. I remember you fucking broke your eyesight. You damaged your eyesight to wear glasses. I remember this story. Don't try to hide... I'm a lover, man. Can you please tell everyone about that story? Oh. TLDR cat, I had a crush. on this one guy and he never spoken to me. But then I overheard his conversation. He's like, Oh, I like people with glasses. So it's like, holy shit. Damn. Okay, then. Let me just break my eyes so then I can wear glasses so you'd like me more. And then I did. And they never, they still haven't never spoken to me. It's crazy. I don't get it. Yeah, chat. She fudged up her eyesight just so that she can appeal to this man that she's never seen anymore in her life again. Worth it. Now I'm like, I can't see shit. Dude, the things we do sometimes. The things we do sometimes. For the people we like. Yeah. Yeah. What's the craziest thing you've done? For, um, it wasn't even that crazy. It's not nearly as crazy as your story, because that's like, that's like insane behavior, in my opinion. Um, not to shade on you or anything like that, because I was, I would never do anything, you know? Um. Anywho, um, the worst thing that I've done, which I think is kind of cute, it's not bad. Um, I went, so me and my grade, my whole grade, we went to a bowling alley and our school rented out the whole bowling alley for our grade, right? So, we had all went to this bowling alley and, um, my crush at the time, um, which was a girl, she was sitting behind me, um, yeah, she was sitting behind me, and I was somewhat near her. and, um, she, I overheard her say to the guy that she liked. I heard her say to him like, oh man, all this, all this pizza made me really thirsty. Like all the grease, I'm really thirsty. And he just sat there and he didn't even do anything, but I overheard her. So I went to go to the bar to get a cup of water and I brought it to her. And I brought it to her. And I was like, I heard you were thirsty, so, uh, I got you a cup of water to help with that. And, and then she grabs the water from me and she goes, oh, that's so sweet. And then she turns to the guy that she liked, and she was like, look, look, she got me a cup of water. 
Oh, seven. One of those pair of babes, besties, heart emoji. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Hello? With a head. Whomimi is a bit of a stinky. What? Are you not going to talk about the person who's sitting next to me? Wait, you are... Whoa. That doesn't really help. I didn't mean to bring the musk. I didn't mean to double it down like this. I don't think it's either of us. I think it's the little fellow on your... shoulder actually. Sorry. Why did he look at me? Did you guys see him turn his face? Someone clip that. Please clip that. They agreed. He gave me the biggest side eye. Oh, there he go. Yeah, he nodded. He knows. He knows it's him. It's all that buildup being who he is, you know. The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, you know. I don't want to say it. Back to Michi's eye story. I wonder why she doesn't just like buy a non-prescription glasses. Because I thought it was Korean chat. Like, I don't want to be a faker, you know? Like, what if they like, like, girls that are blind? So then... But why would any... I don't want to be a fake person? Listen, I don't think if I got... Bro. I'm, I'm not, you know... It's real. I'm not fake like that. You don't... She doesn't... She doesn't want to be eyephish. She wants to be an actual, like, real blind person. She doesn't want to cat with her eyes, yeah, exactly. But to be honest, I put my hand on your shoulder. I don't think that there's any guy out there who genuinely wants a girl who's blind wearing glasses. I think it's more so the appearance of it, I think. I don't know, you might be right. You might be right. I don't know, man. Very young me. I'm very hung up on originality, you know. Yeah, really. It's what it is. I like, I have to be real. So, so what do you do now? Do you, do you just, are you just blind or do you have glasses still? How, how goes it? I wear glasses all the time. It hurts my ears. Wait, do you wear glasses? I do wear glasses, yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm the only one with this problem. Every time I wear my eyes. headphones it presses my like the glasses thick onto my head and it heard does it does it hurt your ears yeah yeah it leaves a mark. I want to blind lady how else will they fall in love with me LL cries I want a blind lady how else will they fall in love? Oh oh that was it oh that was it oh oh What the fuck? That was really funny. Not the sailbird. That was really fucking funny. I'm so fucked up. Okay, I don't blame you. I really truly do not blame you. So tell us, Kamimi, now that you're somewhat getting into the swing of things, right? After setting up for like an hour. So, how do you do it? How have you strained for three years? Whata, what do? Yeah, I don't... Tell us all the secrets. Hello, I streamed for three years. Let me tell you. Chat is also of the opinion that Mitchie behaves insanely, which is why we keep teasing Michi about it in the hope that she will do such things again. Okay, bro. Wow. Wow. You know, you're so fucking funny. You're hilarious. Look at me. I'm laughing. I'm baha ha ha ha ha ha ha. You'll make me rock-a-wow. Wow. That was so funny, guys. Oh my god, that was so fucking funny. Oh my god, I need water. I need water. Oh, that was so. Oh. Oh. Oh. It's not a zoo. That's not even me. Right now. On my body. Kind of. I'm a little bit. Okay. Okay. It was for real. I'm back. Um. Okay. I like, I love when my chat does this stupid fucking thing with it. Hi, what's up. Welcome in. to anyone who's just tuning in. Um, run. They do this really fucking stupid-ass thing where they'll be like, Buh, like, the water next to it, the water spray. You want to know how that originated? How? So, a while ago, a while ago, some people were like spamming, you know the cringe spammers who just like put like eight lines of a really stupid joke to try to get the street. to laugh. So there was one point during my sub-a-thon where people kept spamming, like, the same fucking shit. So they just started going, blah ha ha! You're so funny! Keep going! And then that's how they put it. Uh, hi Minnie! Yo, what's up? Hi Minnie! It was so fun watching you today play with Nueto! I hope you had fun today. It's Nerosama's birthday today, Mitchie. Happy birthday! I saw they were doing like a sub-tone. Yeah, it's really cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I know, it's super cool. Can you believe they've gotten to a point where she can just do sub-ethons? Like, holy fuck, it's so cool. It's insane. When are you gonna do a sub-a-thon? Um... So you asked me about, you know, how do I do it? How do I still stream after three years, right? Let me go on and answer that question for you. you. Wow, okay. I totally don't. No, no, no. You know, Mitchie, I don't want to be rude. I don't want to, you know, ignore that question. Okay, so let's head back to that. Okay. Yeah. Um, how do I do it for three years? Um, I don't know. I, well, obviously, besides my community, being a bunch of fucking dumbasses. Ooh. I love them for it. They know that. They know that. She hates you. Nah. Nah. I love them. No, I love them. I don't love them. I don't love them. I love them. Look at that emote, by the way. It's literally... We know our place, YouTube. Lo. I love you. Yeah, besides them. I don't... I think what makes V-Tubing so much cooler than just streaming in general is the creativity that comes behind it. and how everyone has their own character and their own lore. And I think my favorite part about being a V-tuber is, I don't know about you, but playing into the character. I don't know if you've tuned into me being really stupid silly, but I like to play into it as much as possible. Like, I'm not just a girl who's using a V-tuber model and talking to my chat. No, I like to be like, RR! How dare you say that about me. Yeah. Yeah. girl... Just... Imagine doing that, guys. Wow. I would never do that. I do that too, you know. When I stream, I play up my character and stuff. Yeah. I do it. There's nothing wrong with doing it like that. I just, I like acting. I've always adored it since I was in school. Aww. I think you literally told me it makes sense that I'm a theater kid one time. Yeah, it does. Shut the fuck. You're so. It makes so much sense that you're a theater kid. Go on elaborate on that, please. I dare you. Okay, I can do this. Mm-hmm. Oh my god. Yeah! Ah! Ah! Ah! But, but... Ow! Oh! Oh! Oh. There. It's the most theater kiddy thing I've ever seen my life, bro. Even when I stream. I just go like, bro, I'm just a pixel on screen. I'm gonna break your immersion every three seconds, brother. But I'm not real. Yeah, but some people love that though. Some people fucking love that. People want you to be your true self. You know? Nothing wrong with that, you know? Absolutely not. Exactly. You see, I'm, I'm just me. As a V-tuber, I'm just who I am. I'm just me. I'm not hideous on screen and that's just what it is. Ha ha ha. I am. I'm a 30-year-old man in his mother's basement. Oh. How did you know? Oh. Well, it was obvious. It was absolutely obvious. Damn. What gave it away? The reverb effect in the room or the sudden dank smell? I can smell you through my speakers. P-U. Oh, my God. I've been saying this and I don't know. I keep going... Ewee. Stinky. Ew. Ew. Ew. Ew. What? Ew. Ew. I like to... Dude, yeah. I fucking like to do something similar to that. Like, if there's a really awkward silence between me and another person, I'll be like... Ewee! Tinky! You farted! Ew! You nasty! I was trying to get like an impression of your voice yesterday. Hold on. Okay, wait. Try talking a little bit. Hi, I'm Camila, and I'm talking. I like... Mitchie-mochee a lot. Okay, okay. 
Ah. Hi, Chad. Something. Oh, my voice is too gone to do this, but I did pretty well yesterday. Hey. This is my... Hi, my name's Camilla. Oh, that sounds like I'm insulting you. I can't. Just my voice crack. You sound like Elmo. You make me sound like Elmo. I mean, to be fair. To be fair. Come on, V. You did a good... Listen, I heard you when you switched into my model the first time. You did a really good job. Basically what you did, you were like, Hi, Chad! Hi, I love you, Chad. You know, like, Cat Valentine from Victorious. You know, people would say that, like, my high-pitched voice sounds like Cat Valentine's. Cat Valentine's. I can see it. I can definitely. See it? Yeah. Oh my god. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. The laugh. I cannot. I'd rather end up in a grave, honestly. Oh, wait. Hmm? Okay, from a scale of one to ten, how zooted are you? I'm probably like a 20%. I'm not even near anything. Oh, okay. We'll save it for later. Once you're hired. Trust me, trash we'll be. It'll be good. Okay, hold on. Let me, let me do something so I can assure that we get there faster. Okay. See you on the flip side. Bro, V-tubers are just alcoholics. I don't know what the fight to tell you, bro. Bingo time, find a V-tuber that isn't addicted to drugs or alcohol. Raro. Challenge difficulty impossible. Your favorite V-tuber has problem there. My girls. Dude, I... I fucking wish I can get sued. I, I, when I used to take, um, when I used to take the, the devil gummy, um. What the fuck is a devil gummy? When I used to take it, um, I used to get really horrible anxiety from it, so I stopped. Any time, okay, you know, devil lettuce, you know what that is? Oh! But in good. Oh, I see. I thought you were talking about Viagra, bro. I was like... Brovo. People are crazy. What's going on? Wait, wait, isn't that for... I've always been curious, like, what if... What if we take Viagra? Like, what gets hard? I can... I can damn you. You've taken Viagra! Uh-oh. Okay, um, um. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. You're joking. You're joking. That's not real. You are joking and that's not real. You can't just send me, buh. No way, that's real. I told her, I told her that, um, uh... Blood pressure, yeah. Blood pressure. It gets very gelatinous and hard. Uh... So don't take Viagra as a woman. What? What? What it do for you? Nothing. That's why we're not intended to take it. Boolean. Boring. Ew. Boring. Okay. Well, I mean, we have an equivalent of that, but I hardly ever believe in those. Yeah. What? Um, you know the... The chocolates, the... The special chocolates? The ones that are laced with, um... Huh? What's the word again? No, not... What the fuck did that person just say in my chat? Ew! What is wrong with you? That's disgusting! I have no idea which one you're talking about. I just got like three. Ah! The Aphrodisiac chocolate. That's a thing? That's a thing? Yeah. Except again, I hardly ever think they work. Yeah, Google it. Google it. I mean, like, people say there's always, like, Aphrodisiacs, I think, but I don't believe in it. I don't think so. I don't either. I don't think it work. I really don't agree. Like, you know how people say when you eat oysters or chocolate or strawberries that you feel that stuff? I feel like it's a bunch of nonsense. In my opinion. Yeah. I don't think. I don't know. I don't think those things work. I'm gonna be real with you. But I've always wanted to like randomly take by. I got to see what happens. But I don't think it's a fun time. Is it safe for women to take it? Chat? I feel like if we took that, if we popped it in our mouth, then it would just have zero effect. I think we're gonna blow up. We're gonna turn into a bomb. Kampo! Yep. You don't get it, Chad. The woman's body is a complicated thing. Okay. You take pee-p-hard medicine? You buffflip explode. Buh! No, but I'm... Actually, guys, um... The tune of Land Viagra was originally for heart problems, which means that is not actually, um, for specifically males. It was for your blood heart problems. The side effect is just that so much blood pumps it everywhere, including your pener. Are you actually serious right now? I had no idea that that was the... intended purpose. It's true, guys. Um, they only start branding themselves that way, because so many guys came back being like, Hey, listen, man, my wife wants more. Can you give me like 60 of them? And then they're like, Herm, that's suspicious. What's going on? He's like, my peepee go hard. And they're like, oh, oh, good, good money time. So then now it's my... It's Pee HardMed. That is absolutely blaspheming. I can't even comprehend that. I've heard this news currently. Wait, I must, I must try it immediately. We need to get it effective right now. I need to test it for science. As you know. Exactly, guys. More science, I'll grow a penis. A penis. Right now. Ugh! Whoa! I don't have one of those. I'm sorry. Oh, I got you, hold on. Wait. I already know what you're gonna do. You... Oh, God. It's a phoenet. Oh my god, whoa! Because it's a balloon, it's a white balloon. I... I'm really good with balloons and it's a balloon animal. It's nothing else. Yeah. Did she just all day? Why talk like a mouse? Okay. Okay. What? Me? Someone said, why talk like mouse? No. I'm assuming they're referring to me. there's zero similarity. What? I mean, I get it when they're talking about me, though. I sound exactly like Iron Mouse. I get that all the time, man. I sound exactly like Iron Mouse. No, bro. I get it. I get it. Sometimes people go to my stream. Oh yeah, every day. No, no, I'm kidding. Dude, you have to be deaf if you think I sound like Iron Mouse. To be honest. I know I sound really cute. It is just what it is. You know what I think it is? You know what I think it is? Is Iron Mouse is like such a big V-Tuber. And a lot of people know about her, especially, now because of Kai and stuff. And so I feel like every time a new person comes to a different V-tuber besides Mouse, like, let's say they don't know any V-tubers, their first, like, thought is V-Tuber equals Iron Mouse, because that's the only V-tuber they've heard of. Yeah. I mean, that makes sense. Yeah. Like, to be fair, though, it's one of those things that, like, I feel bad just because I know Mousy would not want to be, like, to be, like, brought up like that. Yeah. For sure. It is what it is. You know, the bigger you get, the more people be like, um, actually, you know, you know who they say I'm a copy pasta of? Who? Um, they say I'm bootleg markiplier, because I'm just that hot. Markiplier. I know. Yep. Sometimes they're like, wow, bootleg markiplier, and I'm like, yep. I'm so tired of it. Every time they bring it up. That's probably, that's probably the most accurate representation I've ever heard in my life. I've ever heard in my life. Whoever said that is onto something, genuinely. Yes, for sure, absolutely. Whoever, no, seriously, you should VIP that guy. Yeah, I think, I'm pretty sure that was my mod. I'm not gonna live. Yep. I thought she was gonna say Nags. Oh my God, I remember when I tuned into your stream once upon a time, and you were, you were reacting to Nags reacting to you. to you. And I was like, what the flying feather is this inception right now? I felt like I was... Oh, my God. Azooted, actually. Recently, I was watching a video of Nags watching me, watching Nags, watching me. What? So there's like three Nags on screen, and this was like, like, three weeks or four weeks apart, and Nags literally look the exact same. Like, same shirt, same pants, same everything, same hairstyle, like, bro is a V-tuber. Okay, he's a V-tuber with one default model. default model bro doesn't change the clothes. He doesn't shower. He doesn't do nothing. What the... It's a concern. What the fuck? It's a concern. He did it again today. Listen. Nags is just a big fan of Mitchie. What can you say, you know? He just really likes Mitchie a lot. And I don't blame him. If you want to get drunk, chat, just watch Nags. Take a shot for every time he looks the exact same. Take one shot when he wears the same outfit, you know? You're going to get drunk. two minute. You want to be plastered? Do you want to be plastered? Take a shot every time he screams. Then you're really cooked. I was fucking talking about that with chat because bro doesn't have like a limiter or like any form of that on his mic. So sometimes, this nag simulator, okay? Oh my god, guys. Um, I think... What the hell guys? I mean, I don't know. I don't really know about... On today's stream, he learned how he learned how he used OBS limits. I'm sorry. Yes. What? Like, if you watch any of his clips, like, I would have to make him like max volume just to hear what he's saying. And then he would get so loud and I'm like, oh. That is true, actually. Now that you mention it both, like, he, when he yells, he's yelling. Like, it's very loud. It's very loud. I love him so much. That makes sense. He is hilarious. He's so funny. When I met him in person, like, Like, the way that he is on his stream is identical to how he is in person. It is actually just so fucking funny. He is so dramatic. It is so funny. Yeah. He's like a person, but make it extra. Yeah. Thank you, Pickle for the raid. Thank you so much. Welcome. Welcome, welcome. Are you actually a pickle v-tuber? I'm kind of curious. I like pickles. Run, roll. Run away. Rutt-row. I'm a little hungry. But yeah, it was so funny because my first impression of nags. Okay, so when we were all at TwitchCon, you know, I kept running into him every now and then, but I don't think I ever formally said hi to him. Because there's just so many V-tubers around. It's really hard to have time to say hi to everyone because it's just so chaotic and there's so much going on, okay? But we had locked eyes so many times beforehand, okay? And so, whenever we did lock eyes, I had something. sort of alcoholic drink in my hand. So the one chance, we finally had time to talk, he goes and tells me, Camila, I sort of fucking got, every time I fucking look at you, you fucking, you have alcohol in your hands. I was like, oh, okay. 
Whoops, you caught me. Dude, I'm in, I'm in the middle of Vegas. Why not? Why not? Dude. Fuck. I know you don't really like drinking, but I swear alcohol does not hit the same, unless I'm in Vegas. Like, it really does not compare. Like, I only drink on very special occasions. I don't get alcohol. Yeah. I only drink, like, in social situations to make it, like, less awkward for other people to drink. But I don't get it. It tastes like shit. It does. It does. It really does. Every time I drink it, I have to, like, hold my nose or something. It's really bad. Why the fuck are you drinking? Because I like the way that it makes me feel. Like, the way a lot of people take, you know, devil, whatever, fuck it, the weed! Anytime people take weed, I can't believe I just said that. He said it, no way. Canceler. Um, I, you know, I wish I could, like, have fun with it. But again, I get really, really anxious when I take it. But when I, when I drink alky hal, I get really, like, ooh, 
but it does taste like shit. I won't lie. I will not lie. It's horrible. Oh, Kamimi. What? That's so bad. You should, uh... You know that fucking, like, Hope Corps video that's like, um... Oh, I forgot. Fuck. Fuck, I'm too medicated. I was like... How it feels... Like, do you know how it feels like... To go one year without alcohol? I don't. I only have one life. And I ain't fucking living it sober. Fuck all of y'all. One life, and I'm gonna live into the fullest. I'm gonna be drunk and I love my alcohol. My alcohol. Wait, wait, pause. I'm not fucking going sober for shit. Oh, no. Keep going. Oh. Guys. Do you know how it feels like to go one month sober? I don't. Fuck allie y'all. I only have one life to live. And I'm living that sober. I don't want to be in the moment. I want to be away from the moment. I don't want to know what's going on around bay. Alcohol is my. friend. Okay, anyone can leave you, alcohol can't leave you. They will never abandon you, and they will never disappoint you. Whenever you need it, they're always there. Fuck sobriary. Fuck sobriary. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Oh, yeah, hell, yeah. Nothing can bring you, nothing can bring you true happiness the same way alcohol does. So never stop, never quit, keep taking that alcohol, keep smiling, keep feeling that absolute happiness that no one else this world could have brought you. Alcohol is your only friend. So never quit on it, as it will never quit on you. Wow. I'm going to cry. I'm going to cry right out of my eyeballs. Right out of my... Where else would you cry? You don't want to know. Okay. But for real, I don't like how it feels like to be drunk. Like, I'm not saying this would be like, woe is I. Wow Yeah. Open the cold one, amen. Oh, do I'm a bear with you? I don't like the feeling of being drunk, but I'm not any better than you, okay? My drug of choice is ketamine. Oh, yeah. Let's go, baby, girl. So you don't have to answer this if you don't want to, obviously. But do you, do you do anything to feel Loopy or do you not really care to feel Loopy anyways? I've been sober for two years, but you've convinced me. I'm not kidding. Ketamine. Oh, actually, ketamine. I wasn't even joking. Like... I thought you were just fooling me. Well... Prescribed. I take prescribed. I have ketamine and benzos. Prescribed. So, can you tell me the difference of how you feel on ketamine versus alcohol and why you don't like alcohol compared to it? I'm kidding. This is actually educational. Okay, so my honest response. Okay. Alcohol, my tummy burning. Oh no, do I need to poop? No, I don't. I just need to lay down and vomit. Oh no, my tummy. Everything is spinning, but my tummy. tummy hurt. Yeah. Now my medication makes me go, Oh, is that a man standing in front of me? What the fuck? Who are these shadow people? Kappa 100 damage, Mici? Oh, fuck all, y'all. And then the next day, I don't remember. Is that a man standing in front of me? What? Imagine, like, blacking out without your tummy hurting, and in like 30 to 40 minutes, depending if you ate beforehand. So like... Yeah. It does make your tummy burn. in... The shadow people's story? Have I told you about the shadow people's story? No, no. Tell me. Don't TLD either. Just say it in full. I don't care. Okay, okay. So what happens, right? Chat knows this. At night, to go to bed, I take prescribed sleep meds. Right? And it just happens to be for tranquilizers. Yeah. So it is what it is. And after like 2-ish a.m., I would be starting to get, like, medicated, because that's when I have to take it. Right. So, one time, I was like working, I was like, working on a project, right? And I was in a call with Kuro. And then I'm starting to get, like, really medicated, because I'm like, okay, I need to go, like, take meds and I just work on this. And then once I'm zooted, I just get knocked down and I go to bed. Yeah. Throughout the whole time, I didn't remember since the next day when Kuro was, like, complaining about it to me. It was like two to three in the morning, right? And I'm just like, like, this is what you hear, okay? Like keyboard sounds like, I don't know. you're like, by the way, there are like people in my room. And he's like, what? And I'm like, there are so many like, like, people, like shadow people. And Kuro's like freaking out. He's like, what the fuck's going on, right? And he's like, what the fuck? What the fuck are talking about? And I'm like, don't say that. They're not going to like you very much. They told me they don't like you very much. And I said all of that. Like I say shit like that. And I don't remember saying any of it. And he's like freaking out. He's like, bro, it's 3 a.m. Shut the fuck up. And I'm like, oh, you don't want to hear them talk? Well, they're not going to like you. One of them said they're going to just visit you at one point. I don't think that's nice to say, man. And I just keep saying it over and over. And then, like, the next day, Kerr told me I freaked them out. And apparently I do that quite often to a lot of people. Because a lot of people say I talk about shadow people. Well. Okay, ha. You know, I don't really see the problem with it. You know why? I think, I think you've made some great friends, if anything. They don't understand. The shadow people? Yeah. Mm-hmm. The shadow people. Because, listen. Impressed cheer, impressed cheer, impress cheer. Thank you. 
All these other people, they don't like it. You want to know why they don't like it? Because they feel threatened that the shadow people will be better friends than they are. That's why they feel, they feel, uh-huh. The shadow people, they understand you. They understand, okay? They get it. it. They realize, they realize that you're psycho and they're okay with it. 
Fucking true, though. True, bro. 
Can I meet them someday? No, I don't even want to meet them. Fuck, do I meet them so bright shit myself. Whoa. Yeah, but you seem to like them when, you know, you're talking to them. Are they putting a gun to your head? Is that why? Is it you're pretending to like them because they're threatening you? Is that what goes on? Oh my god, don't worry, I don't want to go on. If you ever want to see how it, like, how I sound like when I'm medicated, um, every time Zen drags me into a random collab, it's always when I'm like, peak medication, right? Really? Yeah, so every, like, almost, like, 90% of the collabs I did with Zen on her stream, I don't remember. I literally do not remember I did it until I watch a clip over the next day and I'm like, what the fuck, we did that? So is it like, is it like alcohol too where if you take too much or if you get too drunk or too zoon or, or whatever. You don't remember what happened? It's like blacking out, genuinely like blacky out. Oh my gosh. Whoa! You remember like little bit and then it's gone. Like the whole night's gone after that one point. And that's when you start like, like physically how you feel is the world spins. Imagine getting vertigo. Oh, I see. I see. But your eyes, it looks like you have eye poop and then you get vertigo. And that's how it feels like. I poopie. Bensos have a legion. I poopie. Spini, spinny, ew. Ew. Dang. It's true. I've been to those streams. Now I'm curious. My dad. And one of the things that happened recently was apparently I said I would shove a spoon up my ass so I could be a big spoon. And Chat thought it was so fucking funny. And they're like, oh yeah, she shoved the spoon. I have never shoved the spoon up my ass, okay? It was the joke. The joke was the big spoon. That was what I was trying to get across. But what if... Take this. What if you forgot? 
The realization on her face? Be right back. Wait. You're in my ass to check. Let me grab the metal detector. I just put it next to her. What do you got there in your buddies? A spoon, sir. Bro, it just maxes out the metal detector because there's like 30 in there. There's like 30 in there. Roro. I'm sorry, Mr. Officer, sir. I have a spoon. It's just my ladle. Is that why you have an obsession with spoons? No, I actually like spoons normally. Okay, I have a normal sane, wholesome obsession with spoons. I do not shove it anywhere near my rectum. Thank you very much. You shove it in your mouth? Do you actually use the spoons that you collect or now? No. You just have them collection. They're so pretty. They're mine forever. I'm gonna steal them. I'm gonna steal them. What's your first impression of everyone? I want to know. Of everyone? You can be so honest, okay. Chat, if you cancel us, I'm gonna punch you in the face. Yeah, tell me your first impression of your friends. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Rurro. Uh-oh. Well, can I start with you? Oh. Can I start with you? I'll leave. Okay, you know what? Yeah. Hit me with the truth. I'm gonna hit it. And here we go. Okay, okay. When I first met- Yeah, chat, get it right. Mitty has only ever had a camcorder shoved up her bum. A camcorder? That's true. Did you take an exam? Yeah, it was like endotropy or whatever. Okay, the doctor shoved it up my eyes and I have pictures. It's so cool. Oh, very cool. Wait, you have pictures? You have a picture of my rectum, but I'm only gonna sell it for... 5,000 below. Guys, 6,000 likes and she'll post them live. If I even cleaned myself for that picture, chat, I shat myself for a day and a half straight. Oh, very nice. Very nice. Like a colonoscopy. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah, I got it in... Well, I don't remember, actually. They knocked me to fuck out. Wait, did they make you only have certain liquids before that? Like, you couldn't eat anything? Because I know that's how it usually goes. Yeah, you can't eat anything for a day, and then you drink laxative and shit yourself. Yeah. Well, at least you cleaned out your system. And all she got out of it was a hatred of lemons. Lemons. Yeah, now I fucking hate lemons, because they're like here. To make your experience better, we made the lax taste like lemons, and now I'm traumatized. Okay. Because it's just lemon on lemon on lemon. No, it's lemon. And then you shit yourself for a day and a half. It's just not the best experience. Wait. Okay, this is kind of nasty. Please excuse me. If you're shitting lemons, does it burn? Because of the acidity? Oh, I don't think so, because I was shitting out lax. Oh, okay. It was like lemon-flavored lax. But I think if you eat that much lemons, then yeah, it'd probably be burned. Oh. It's like if you eat like spicy food. you know your bud burn. Ouchy. Ouchy. Yeah. Dude, I remember recently I had to poop. I poop so much and so hard that my butt was burning. It was really painful. Like, recently, I went to the hospital for really bad intestinal virus. I don't know how the fuck I got it. I really do not. But yeah, it was like a few weeks ago when I was in the hospital because my intestines were fucking hurting really bad. And so, yeah. Like, I kept, I kept pooping, like, every... Impress, melt, impress, boo, impress flushed, impress, boo, impress flushed, impress, Impress, flushed, impress lute, impress hyper's impress melt. Oh, really, nice. So, yeah, because of the intestinal virus, I was pooping, like, literally every 10 minutes. And it got to a point where I started from 9 in the morning to... It was like 7 p.m. I was still in the hospital, and around 7 p.m., when they discharged me from the hospital, I was still pooping, and I kid you not, the pain from pooping so much was worse than the intestinal pain. Because, you know, when you poop so much, it starts scratching down there? Like, it was so painful. Velt guess it's a bad time to mix this hot chocolate to wear. Oh, very, very, very, very slow. Now you should slurp it very slowly. This story should encourage you to chug it. 
Ew. Oh, yeah. It was bad. I get it, though. I fucking, I hate pooping, bro. Poopin, so case. I don't like it. Yeah. Yeah. Well, at least too much of it, because I do enjoy a good poop every now and then. You know, it helps clean out your system. It helps make you feel less bloated. I enjoy pooping. I don't know. I hate shit and hurt my butt o'er. Sometimes Numi and I will just send ratings of our poop. Like, if she just sat on the toilet and, like, pooped, if it was like a bad poop, she'll tell me. Camilla, it was like a three out of ten. And I'm like, okay. And then I tell her mine. We just, you know, we just do it sometimes. 
I love you, girl, but I hope we never reach that point. Why? 
That signifies true friendship. Why would I send pictures of my poop? You know what? I like my, I know it's call me a freak chat, but I like my friends. Hey, how's your day? Oh, that's nice. And the convo. Whatever happened to, hi, how are you? Yeah, whatever the fuck happened to how's the weather? What the fuck is this shit? Yeah, but that's small talk. That's boring. That's NPC talk. Hi, how are you? Oh, true. Like, come on. I like to spice it up a little bit. Ah, bro, you like to spice it about a bit too much. What the fuck is this shit? You know who would fit right into this combo? Froggy. Why? Do you know anything about Froggy? Oh. Did that? resonate for a moment? Like, why did they mention? All I know about Froggy is Froggy's super cool. Mm-hmm. But if you think I get medicated more, nah, bro. Froggy's like me three times more. What? I don't know. She's crazy. But like, in a fun way, but crazy. Oh my gosh. So you can see that I'm like leaning back in my chair. It's okay, as long as you're comfortable. Just don't fall. Get it go. Don't fall and flip over. So tell me, what's your first impression of me? All right. I must know. The story. I'll tell you mine of yours. Okay. What the fuck English heart. Sure thing. It's okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. English is barely even my first language. It's fine. Fuck English. I spoke uga-buga when I was born, so it's fine. I don't speak at all. Oh, really? So how am I understanding you? Is it through brain waves? Is it through neurons? We're transmitting your one neuron with each other. Okay. My first impression of Mitchie is that she, she, Okay, you can be honest. Be 100% honest, do it. Do it, no balls. 
You know those types of, like, old ladies that, like, live in a little nook, and they have, like, a bunch of, like, different collections of, like, a bunch of random, like, knick-knacks and, like, wooden carvings, and she sometimes talks to them. You know, that kind of lady? She'll just speak to them. Like, that's kind of the impression that I got of Mitchie at first. She's like a little cuckoo lady who just speaks, you know, tells these little wooden carvings about her day and how much the flower she was talking to made her laugh that day. The sunshine, everything of that sort. Yeah, that is kind of the first impression I had about you. 
You know, you know the movie Brave, that lady in the first. with like literally all those one that that's how I saw you at first here let me get a picture in case you're not fully remembering old lady wow you just have to let me just the old lady hag person crazy lonely the keywords this this this is my first impression though this is my first impression of mitchie mochee Wow you know what you're not even wrong the only thing I need is a bird and I'll be fun He's just a fucking crow That's fucked up, you just dogs me That's fucked up, you just dogs me, that's fucked up No way Okay, you want my real answer When I first met Mitchie The real answer Blah! What the fuck? Um I think the first time I ever spoke to her was when a long time ago she was just streaming something I don't remember and I True. I was introduced to her from another friend and I was I think I think literally I was trying to type Twitch emotes in her chat like 7 TV ones Because I wanted to Sorry, I hope you don't mind that Mitchie I was trying I think I was trying to like write 7 TV emotes in her chat and it wasn't working So then I was like, wait, does she not know what 7 TV is? And she was like, no, what is that? And then I, and then, and then, and then that's how we started talking. Wait, is that how we start talking? Yeah, literally, literally. That's how we first talked. That's not what I remembered. I think. Well, I'm, I'm kind of altering the story just a tad bit, because I don't want to be in too detail. Does that make, does that make sense? Because, like, my first, like, time I've ever seen you was you was you were streaming on Twitch, right? Yeah. One of my, one of our mutual friends introduced you to me, and I was like, it was like, you need to check this person out, man. This person is so cool. And I remember watching you and you were like, like still a baby. You were like a small little baby, like small baby streamer, you know? And then you were like, oh my God, is there Michi, hold on. I got something just for you, wait a minute. And I was like, oh. Oh, my God, no way. And then he played a song and danced to like a background with hearts in it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It was a Drake song, I remember, and I was like, what the fuck? Yeah, here, here, I'll DM you, I'll DM you. Yeah, I think it was Rich Flex. Okay, here. I think it was. Okay, okay, reading. What the fucking shit is happening? What? 
Oh my God. You're... Big old, buddy, erroney gift. Oh, my God, that's, like, that's enough to go buy, like, a new pair of boots. Thank you. That I can kick Mitchie with. Thank you so much. Oleg. Oh, not this shit again. Kick you like a soccer ball. Thank you for the 50. No, you fucking chat. We got to kick a chat in chat right now. What the fuck. Yeah, what the hell, dude. Thanks so much. I don't know, maybe because she's in my model. She seems way more puntable than usual. I think that's what it is. I don't know why I look so angry in your model. I think I just have a resting angry face. Resting, bitch. Hold on. Okay, look, let me tell you. 
There. Was that a thing? Yes. I did that? Oh, did I? But I don't... Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
Okay, okay, yeah, just essaying, as saying. Oh, oh. Oh. Oh. 
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, yeah. No way. That's crazy. That was our first talk. But first impression, because I still haven't said that yet. She was. She was really kind to me at first and just super, like, interested. Yeah, she fucking hates me now. But she seemed really like, I think because the... So the friend that we're talking about, like, they talked to you, they talked about you so highly. So that's why I wanted to come check you out. And he told me that he was, he was talking to you so highly about me. It kind of seems like he was trying to make us friends. He's like, this is a crazy bitch and this is a crazy bitch. Let them get to know each other. 
They better speak of us highly. Look at us. Fuck yeah. 
But yeah. I'm so glad I did because you're cool. Somewhat. 
Somewhat. Emphasize. 
You want to know my. My first impression of you? Only if you want to. 
Oh, God. How, um, how positive do you want it to be? Oh, no, let it rip. Let it rip. I, I quite literally, I think I spat on you. I kicked, I did everything the worst, but you could go crazy, dude. I deserve it. 
Go ahead. I don't think you were bad. Okay. cool thing is I was like, oh, this person, this person is just here for a fun time. And I like that. Guys, Mitchie's brutally honest. So get ready. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now I feel right. Okay. No, no, I want you too. I want you too. When we first met, I was like, oh, this person just here for a fun time. But then, at that time, you were like, different from now. You know, like, we've known each other for a while. So it's like, back then, you weren't like this. You were like a bit more different. And I was. I was like, holy, this person got no backbone. Oh, okay. In my defense, though, the first time I spoke to Kamimi, right? Imagine someone who gaslights themselves and then has a full monologue and gaslights themselves in that monologue. That was Kamimi. Like, I don't know what's going on, you know? Because, like, I'm chilling. And Kamimi's like, oh, I like this. Oh, but, but actually, maybe, maybe if you don't like it, you know. If you don't like it, it, it's fine. It's okay. But I like, it's like. It's okay. No, you didn't even do that. You were like, I like this. Oh, but. And then like, let's say someone goes like, oh, I don't quite like it. And you're like, oh, no, that's super fine. I mean, like, I didn't quite like it too. Like, I also thought it was like, like, like, I didn't. I mean, honestly, I don't think I like it either. And I was like, girl. I just like the things you like. I really did not have my own opinion. See, that's something that Mitchie says about me often is that, like, I, I, I don't know if this caters into that Mitchie, but she tells me that I let people walk all over me. Or at least I used to. I used to. Yeah. She used to tell me like, she's like, you know, Kamimi, you need to stop thinking of other people. You need to start thinking more about yourself and what you want to do and how you want to think and all this stuff. I, yes. Growing up, you crazy, girl. No, dude, I was like an insane people pleaser, so it makes sense. I still am. There's no doubt in my mind that I am. But at least now, I feel like I am strong enough to fucking start talking for myself. And I don't know. That's just what I think. I think I'm somewhat better. I'll say this. Like, Kamimi's really nice, but holy, what I noticed, okay, to be fair, when I first meet someone, I noticed, like, they're bad. traits more than they're good because that's how I do it. But it doesn't mean I hate you. It just, I was like... It's just something that, like, you can just focus on more because it's more noticeable, I guess. It's not more noticeable. It's just like, I want to be wary about it, you know? Because sometimes, like, people's bad traits are like real bad, you know what I mean? Like gut feelingy bad. You're like, oh, okay, maybe, maybe I don't like hell of everything. You know what I mean? Gut feeling, yeah. I have that about certain people, too. It's good to just keep your walls up, I guess. I mean, that's like, I don't trust that many people. So, when I met you, I was like, my first concern was I need to be careful not to accidentally, like, influence this person in a bad way. So I think for the first couple of months we were talking, I never gave my opinion. I would always ask you for your opinion first. Because, like, I don't want to accidentally, like, gaslight her because she does it herself. So I was like, you're crazy. You crazy, girl. Like, you're like, oh, well, I don't really like doing that. But I'll do. do it and I'm like, you don't like doing it, but you'll do it. It's like, yeah, it's going to be nice. I'll be like, no, no, it's not. Because you're not going to like it. Hello? 
I would literally, I would literally tell her, I would literally tell her, I'd be like, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what's not really anything, but I guess I'll do it. I guess I'll, I guess it will be fun, you know, whatever. I'll give it a try, you know, I, I, I, I, you know, I, I, you know, I, you know, I, I, you know, I, you know, I've actually had this conversation with. my best friend recently, um, and she, she, she quite literally told me, she was like, I'm really proud of you because you are not letting people, you know, walk all over you as much as you used to before. I feel like, she told me, I feel like streaming really has helped you become more confident within yourself and, so that's really, that was really nice to hear. Um, I think part of the reason why I was like that before was because I never felt like I was enough. So I guess that's why. What? 
But I didn't. I never thought I was. So I tried to be enough for people. So that's why I would do the things that I did, I guess. I didn't think that I was. I remember. I remember the moment like I noticed you started standing up for yourself. And I even DM'd you out of nowhere. I was like, hey man, I'm kind of proud you're doing this. Good job. Because like, that was one thing that I, not hated, but I was like, like, like, a bit, yeah. About. Because I was like, girl, you. what the fuck you're why you act like a human punching bag this is so weird this is so weird it's like I'm like I just know what the bug yeah I remember like I wasn't I felt bad because you're so sweet so I can't be like girl snap out of it okay you're acting really fucking stupid yeah you didn't want to tell me yeah my only response to every time you do some time that I go like huh girl that's all I say what hey I say I go like Oh, hold up. Girl, what the fuck do you mean by that? And she's just like, I mean, it's fine, it's fine. It's fine. Blah, ha, ha, ha, ha. And I'm like, Girl. Your impression of me is. Oh, my God. But honestly, Chad, I, can I be honest? Like, I fucking love with my friends tear into me like this. Because it really is, like, it makes me self-realize about myself a lot of things. Because I wouldn't know this about myself until someone points it out to me. So this is good. This is good. And I'm telling you, man, you are more than enough. You are insane if you think you don't. I'm going to punch you in the face. What the fuck is wrong with you? I don't know. I certainly have reached a point where I feel like I do deserve more than what I used to think I deserved. So, yeah. Finally. Yes. I'm proud. I'm proud. I've achieved so heck and much and I'm, I'm like, I'm like keep reminding myself that. that. Some of you, you're all so incredible. I love you. Yeah, yeah. 
That's me being a people-fazer. No way, guys. Impossible. I'm telling you. I keep saying this, right? Because people, so they say the same thing, where it's like, Michi, you talk so much shit. Hi, Shaya. Like, people say, like, you talk so much shit, but like, you're insecure. The differences, chat, I suck my dick every now and then, okay? There are days where I'm like, like, the differences. I am too much of an ass. Like, I, I look at people and I'm like, oh, I have a bad gut feeling about you, so I'm not, I'm not gonna, like, be close with you. I don't have proof, it's a gut feeling. You know what? I feel like an ass, but like, like, I don't know, sometimes I'm telling you, man, you got trust your gut feeling, right? So I'm like, my gut feeling says you're an okay person, but I'm not going to, like, be too too, too, like, trusting of you until, like, I'm sure. and because of that, not a lot of people can walk all over me, just because I don't know a lot of people. 
Yeah, yeah. I don't know a lot of people. The people that I know don't ask anything of me. So I'm like, yay. Yay. I like it like this. Yeah. So that's the difference. Women's intuition. Bro, it's like a tingling in your ball sack, okay? Have you ever met someone and you're like, huh
